You will need to install libelf development package (or source + headers).
On Debian you can run:

	apt-get install libelfg0-dev libgpgme-dev

Currently this package has only been tested on Linux.  I don't expect it to 
be extremely portable at this time.

More to the point, I've built and tested it with the following Debian packages:

	kernel         2.4.20
	gcc            2.95.4-17
	libc6-dev      2.3.1-16
	libgpgme-dev   0.3.15-1
	libelfg0-dev   0.8.2-1
